# CS188 Projects
Projects I and one teammate have completed so far for UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. These projects focus on the Pacman world in order to AI concepts like informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.

## Project 1: Search
We implemented graph-search algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search, A* search) and heuristics to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in a Pacman maze. 

## Project 2: Multi-agent Search
We implemented minimax, alpha beta pruning, expectimax, and an evaluation function to design agents for Pacman. 

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
We implemented Q-learning and value iteration for Pacman agents.

## Project 4: Ghostbusters
We implemented exact and approximate inference and particle filtering algorithms using Bayes Nets in order for Pacman to locate and track ghosts given noisy distance readings.
